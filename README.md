*A wireless thermometer for barbecuing and smoking*

Um right, but what is it?
------------------------
The Cooker Thermometer can measure the temperatures of up to three different pieces of meat. If you happen to have a smoker of some sort, e.g. the Weber Smokey Mountain, it can also assist you in keeping the right temperature for low-and.slow cooking by measuring the temperature at the top of the smoker.

The thermometer is wireless and transmits its measures using RF (434MHz RFM12B) to a Raspberry Pi base station, which in turn stores the measures in a database. The front-end is a custom Android app that handles sessions and reads the measures from the database, presenting them with alerts and graphs.
